    Optimal Prompt Structure (100-300 words)
    Your prompt should flow naturally while incorporating all vital elements in a coherent sequence:

    1. Lead with Your Subject
      Begin with a clear, detailed description of your main focus
      Example: "A graceful ballet dancer in a flowing white dress"
      Keep it specific but concise
    2. Establish Your Scene
      Immediately follow with the setting details
      Example: "Inside a grand, historic theater with ornate golden decorations"
      Set the stage for your action to unfold
    3. Describe the Action
      Detail the motion sequence that will occur
      Example: "The dancer performs a fluid pirouette, her dress creating circular patterns in the air"
      Focus on smooth, continuous movements that work well in a 5-second timeframe
    4. Specify Camera Work
      Include clear camera movement instructions
      Example: "Camera slowly circles around the dancer, starting at eye level and gradually ascending"
      Ensure camera movements complement your subject's action
